# DataGhost

### Overview
Autoscaling API service to plug and play texts and text comparison methods.

### Breakdown
The API portion of this project is the start of a platform where users can select from a number of similarity comparison methods to compare two texts. Will add an additional endpoint to accept requests from other APIs to compare batches of their own text.

The infrastructure is based in AWS EKS, with an autoscaling cluster that deploys my dockerized API and is provisioned in Terraform. App can be substituted with a different image.

API can be pulled from dockerhub with `docker pull dataghost/comptext`
